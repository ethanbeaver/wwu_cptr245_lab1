We had a positive experience working together as wa pair. The use of git made the code integration between the two of
us easy. The forking in GitHub made acquiring the project easy. We had no issues working with Travis CI, it integrated
very nicely with github. Catch was also a pleasure to work with. It didn't require any troubleshooting or setup and was
very easy to pick up.

We had a few struggles throughout this project. The biggest one was dealing with mathematical precision. When working
quadratic() and squareRoot(), we had a hard time writing out tests when dealing with infinite decimals. To counteract
this, we integrated rounding at a specified precision. Another issue we faced was working with not well defined
requirements. For example, we weren't given a specified precision to round to in the mathematical functions. The
parsingStudentName() functions proved to be a challenge because of the many different test cases possible. There were
numerous ways to break the function and many different types of errors to handle.
